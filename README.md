Hello Everyone,

I'm an ex-math teacher turned developer who's always excited to create something new and vaulable, and to learn new things.  
My other passion-profession is music and music production.
In my free time/"me" time, you can catch me reading self-help books, practicing martial arts, watching a Marvel movie, or napping REALLY hard.

P.S. I love dogs and own arguably the most adorable one on earth, "Hershey".
