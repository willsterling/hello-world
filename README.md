Hello Everyone,

I'm an ex-math teacher turned developer who's always excited to learn something new and vaulable.  
My other passions are music and music production.
In my free time or "me" time, you may catch me reading novels or self-help books, practicing a martial arts move, watching a Marvel movie, or napping.

P.S. I love dogs and own arguably the most adorable one on earth, "Hershey".
