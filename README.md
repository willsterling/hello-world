Hello Everyone,

I'm an ex-math teacher turned developer who's always excited to create something new and vaulable, and to learn the likewise.  
My other passion-profession is music and music production.
In my free time or "me" time, you may catch me reading novels or self-help books, practicing a martial arts move, watching a Marvel movie, or napping.

P.S. I love dogs and own arguably the most adorable one on earth, "Hershey".
